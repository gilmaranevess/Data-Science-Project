Provincial statistics on the employment rate in Canada from 1976-2019. Data in this file is presented according to month, province, gender, and type of employment (full-time, part-time, and all). Kagglers are welcome to play with this data to gain a better understanding of the trends of employment in Canada during the last few decades. While the data was originally retrieved from the Labour Market Council of Canada, more data is this sort is available from Statistics Canada.

The specific challenge by the LMIC was to assess the patterns in employment among the provinces, Alberta and Ontario in the last 13 years. Did trends diverge or converge during this time?
